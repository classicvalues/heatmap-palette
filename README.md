heatmap-palette
===============

This colorblind-friendly heatmap palette relies on a green-to-red spectrum, which typically implies intensity or activity. For the red/green colorblind, however, these hues are particularly difficult to distinguish bewteen. Most colorblind-friendly solutions rely on a different set of hues altogether (usually yellows and purples) to solve this problem, but this palette maintains the red/green symbolism while achieving deuteranopic legibility by varying the perceived brightness of the hues.

The end result is a heatmap spectrum that reads intuitively for the fully-sighted as well as those with varying degrees of red/green colorblindness. To read more about its development and see examples, visit http://wistia.com/blog/heatmaps-for-colorblindness.

The use of these colors is strongly encouraged, and permitted under the MIT license.
